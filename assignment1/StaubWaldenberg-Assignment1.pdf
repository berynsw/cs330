Beryn Staub-Waldenberg cs330 Assignment1 Fall 2019

My program does compile and run correctly. I'm not aware of any obvious parts of my program that aren't working. However, I'm sure some things could be done more efficiently. I have individual crazy days and splits stored as string arrays which means I have to convert values within them from Strings to Doubles a couple of times. Parsing and converting a given number once (for example the percent difference of the high and low stock price on a given day) could be stored as a double after it's calculated initially instead of being left as a string. However, this would mean creating an additional structure to store the value returned by calcPercentChange on a given day. It seems that there is sometimes a trade off between space complexity and time complexity in a situation like this. I think I spent about 15 hours on this assignment.

Expected Score
